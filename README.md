# Line-detector
Develop a program that can identify lines in a photo and convert them into a DXF file, enabling compatibility with CNC machines for precise machining.
The program is intended for automatic detection of the edge of a teak floor obtained from barges.
Thus, it is not necessary to cut the floor manually, but we can send the .dxf file to the CNC, which cuts the wood into the desired shape.

For camera calibration I used code from: https://github.com/niconielsen32
